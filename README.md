prototyping a game with claude code due to general ignorance/hopefulness.
there are so many systems missing, but what works so far is:
- map generation (we got something workable)
- car controls (it flies and i am liking them so far)
- people wanting to go places to pick up and deliver
- scoring system (basic, useless, but it's something)
----
to be implemented:

- other cars, and ways for them to move around/be in the way
- more building variety, and moving obstacles such as trains
- upgrades system to spend your hard earned points
- communication layer between cars (so you/them can say "sorry" or "fuck you" after collisions)
- damage system for cargo/people, and consequences for their destruction
- other jobs other than just taxi fares (fetch quests, infrastructure maintenance assistance)
- SOUND FXs
- music
- cool af customizable UI
- cool af customizable controls
but yo it takes time and multiple people to do this stuff, and i have no colleagues yet!
----
the controls at time of writing are as such:
- WASD - drone hover controls
- Q/E - drone hover yaw rotation
- space/C - drone hover upwards/downwards, rotate boosters
- Shift - boost
----
- up/down arrow - pitch down/upwards whole car
- left/right arrow - rotate booster shins asymetrically
----
- Z - toggle height lock (disabling this makes you fall faster/climb slower)
- X - handbrake. doublepress to lock on, press again to unlock (or C/Space) (disables drone thrusters)
- V - toggle autohover safety (engages heightlock when near floor)
- Alt - switches arrow controls to manual booster rotation
----
- F - lock currently pressed controls
- R - Start/Confirm, used to start shifts
- T - Select/Cancel, used to select shifts (also, mash it to eject a passenger early)
----
if the car tilts too much it disables (most) controls for a short time, just so you know.

pls donut steel, work with me instead :)
